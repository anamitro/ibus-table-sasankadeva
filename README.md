DOCUMENTATION: Sasankadeva Unicode, a free add-on for typing Bangla in Linux
Copyright © 2021 Anamitro Biswas


Requirements: 'ibus-table' must be installed in your computer and 'ibus' selected as the input method.
'Sasankadeva (Unicode)' is semi-phonetic, i.e., a midway between the accuracy of grammatical typing and the ease of phonetic Indic typing. The ease has been ensured in many ways, including spelling statistics, character combinations and multiple options to be used as suits. Along with our own set of input keys, most popular input strings from widely used Avro Phonetic and itrans-Bangla are also supported.
	Apart from useful well-defined shortcuts that save time while typing, we have fixed phonetic-based layout for all usual character combinations in Indian Bengali, so that the user can practically type without looking at the screen if he chooses to. Also, suggestions come up, to be selected from if one is more comfortable with them. We aim at making an algorithm that provides space for both well-defined inputs with phonetic variations, has sets of methods that suits both proffessional and layman typing with one or two hands, that are easy to learn and easier to apply. The interface has been built in ibus-table environment.
	
	For just using the ibus-table to type Bengali, you need only the files Sasankadeva.db and Sasankadeva.svg.
	See Sasankadeva.txt if you want to see the source code, COPYING for licensing information and INSTALL for installation guide.
	
	Read Documentation for detailed typing instructions
	
	For example,
নারায়ণং নমস্কৃত্য নরঞ্চৈব নরোত্তমম্।	narayN` nmsK<V] nrncaib nrotVmm\.
দেবীং সরস্বতীং ব্যাসং ততো জয়মুদীরয়েৎ।।	debii` srswtii` byas` tto jymudiiryet``..

Obviously, other input can also yield the same result, e.g., 'দেবীং' as 'debee`' etc.
